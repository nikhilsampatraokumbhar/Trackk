- [x] 116 unit/integration tests passing (6 test suites)
- [x] SMS notification deduplication

### Client-Side Email & FCM Integration
- [x] `FcmService.ts` — FCM device token registration, refresh listener, foreground/background handlers
- [x] `EmailService.ts` — Client-side email connection via Cloud Functions (connect/disconnect)
- [x] Connect Email UI in ProfileScreen (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo with connect/disconnect)
- [x] FCM registration wired into AuthContext (auto-register on sign-in, cleanup on sign-out)
- [x] TrackerContext handles email-detected FCM push notifications (both platforms)
- [x] `@react-native-firebase/messaging` added to dependencies and app.json plugins

### Build & CI
- [x] EAS Build configuration (Android + iOS simulator profiles)
- [x] GitHub Actions APK build workflow (release APK)
- [x] Firebase project configuration (.firebaserc, firebase.json)
- [x] Fixed `babel-preset-expo` version to `~55.0.0` (was ~13.0.0, caused codegen failures)
- [x] Fixed `react-native-screens` to `~4.23.0` and `react-native-safe-area-context` to `~5.6.2` (Expo 55 compat)
- [x] Fixed `settings.gradle` project name (ExpenseTrackerBuild → Trackk)
- [x] Added `googleServicesFile` to `app.json` for Android + iOS prebuild
- [x] Copied `google-services.json` to project root
- [x] Added `GoogleService-Info.plist` placeholder for iOS
- [x] iOS `app.json` config: bundleIdentifier, UIBackgroundModes, deep link scheme

## Pending — Pre-Launch

### Payment Integration (Priority 1)
- [ ] Set up Firebase Blaze plan (required for Cloud Functions)
- [ ] Install Firebase CLI (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
- [ ] Set Razorpay secrets:
  ```
  firebase functions:secrets:set RAZORPAY_KEY_ID
  firebase functions:secrets:set RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET
  ```
- [ ] Deploy Cloud Functions: `cd functions && npm install && cd .. && firebase deploy --only functions`
- [ ] Deploy Firestore rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
- [ ] Flip `USE_PRODUCTION_PAYMENT` to `true` in `src/services/PaymentService.ts`
- [ ] End-to-end test: payment → verification → subscription activation

### Email OAuth Setup (Priority 1)
- [ ] Create Google Cloud OAuth 2.0 credentials (Gmail API)
- [ ] Register Azure AD app (Microsoft Graph API for Outlook)
- [ ] Register Yahoo Developer app (Yahoo Mail API)
- [ ] Set email OAuth secrets:
  ```
  firebase functions:secrets:set GMAIL_CLIENT_ID
  firebase functions:secrets:set GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET
  firebase functions:secrets:set MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID
  firebase functions:secrets:set MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET
  firebase functions:secrets:set YAHOO_CLIENT_ID
  firebase functions:secrets:set YAHOO_CLIENT_SECRET
  ```
- [ ] Create Pub/Sub topic for Gmail push notifications
- [x] ~~Add "Connect Email" UI to Android app~~ (done — added to ProfileScreen for both platforms)
- [x] ~~Register FCM device tokens on client side~~ (done — FcmService.ts + AuthContext wiring)
- [ ] End-to-end test: email → parse → FCM notification → add to tracker

### Promo Codes (Priority 1)
- [ ] Add promo codes to Firestore `promoCodes` collection for server-side validation
- [ ] **REMOVE `NKTEST2026` test promo code before public launch** (`src/store/PremiumContext.tsx:138`)

### Testing (Priority 2)
- [ ] Build release APK and test with `NKTEST2026` promo code
- [ ] Test all premium features in release build
- [ ] Test payment flow end-to-end (after Razorpay setup)
- [ ] Test group sync across multiple devices
- [ ] Test SMS parsing with real bank messages on release APK

- [ ] App icon and splash screen finalization
- [ ] Play Store listing assets (screenshots, description, feature graphic)
- [ ] Privacy policy and terms of service pages
- [ ] Rate/review prompt after positive usage milestones

## Backlog — Post-Launch

### Features
- [ ] Export transactions to CSV/PDF
- [ ] Recurring expense tracking
- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Widgets (daily spend, budget remaining)
- [ ] iOS app (email-only detection, no SMS — Cloud Functions already built)
- [ ] Inbound email parsing for non-Gmail/Outlook/Yahoo providers (SendGrid/Mailgun)

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Migrate from AsyncStorage to MMKV for faster local storage
- [ ] Add E2E tests (Detox or Maestro)
- [ ] Add Crashlytics / Sentry for error monitoring
- [ ] Server-side analytics (usage metrics, funnel tracking)
- [ ] CI pipeline for automated testing on PR

## Architecture Notes

- **Local-first**: Personal expenses stored in AsyncStorage, groups synced via Firestore
- **Payment security**: Razorpay key_secret never on client; all payment verification server-side via Cloud Functions
- **Dev vs Prod**: `USE_PRODUCTION_PAYMENT` flag in PaymentService.ts; dev promo codes behind `__DEV__`
- **State management**: Context API + useMemo optimization (no Redux needed at current scale)
- **Dual detection**: Android uses SMS (primary) + email parsing; iOS uses email parsing only
- **Email providers**: Gmail (Pub/Sub push), Outlook (Graph API webhook), Yahoo (5-min polling)
- **Email use cases**: iOS users, reimbursement/corporate card tracking, foreign trips (temp SIM = no bank SMS)
- **FCM flow**: Cloud Functions detect email transaction → store in `pendingTransactions` → send FCM to all user devices → client shows notification with tracker actions
- **Client-side email**: EmailService.ts calls Cloud Functions; ProfileScreen shows connect/disconnect UI per provider
- **Cross-platform groups**: Android + iOS users can share groups, split expenses, settle debts — groups synced via Firestore
